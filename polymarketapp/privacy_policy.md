Welcome to Polymarket Viewer app. This app is an unofficial client that provides access to a curated selection of prediction markets from the Polymarket platform. To ensure a focused and policy-compliant experience, the app primarily features markets from specific categories, such as technology. This app is provided free of charge and is intended to be used as is.


This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our App.


If you choose to use our App, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the App. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.


The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Polymarket Viewer unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our App, we may collect minimal anonymous usage statistics. The information collected is aggregated and anonymized, containing no personal identifiers.

### Anonymous Usage Analytics

The app collects the following anonymous technical information to help us understand app usage and improve the experience:
- App version number
- Android SDK version
- Device language setting
- Build type (debug/release)
- First launch indicator

**Important:** This anonymous analytics feature can be disabled at any time in the app's About screen settings. No personal information or device identifiers are ever collected.

### Third Party Services

The app uses third party services to provide functionality:

- [Polymarket API](https://polymarket.com/tos) - for market data
- Cloudflare Workers - for anonymous analytics (opt-out available)

## Log Data

We want to inform you that whenever you use our App, in a case of an error in the app we may collect minimal diagnostic data. When anonymous analytics is enabled, our analytics server may temporarily log your IP address for the purpose of aggregating usage statistics. No personally identifiable information is stored or retained beyond temporary server logs.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This App does not use cookies or tracking identifiers. The app may interact with third-party APIs (like Polymarket) that use cookies on their end. You have full control over anonymous analytics collection through the in-app settings.

## Service Providers

We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
- To facilitate our App
- To provide the App on our behalf
- To perform App-related services (e.g., data fetching, image loading, chart display)
- To collect anonymous usage statistics (opt-out available)

We want to inform users of this App that these third parties may have access to minimal anonymous technical data (like IP address through network requests for analytics). The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. No personal information or device identifiers are shared with third parties.

## Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This App may contain links to other sites (e.g., Polymarket website). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
